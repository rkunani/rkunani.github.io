<p>This guide is meant to go over the key ideas of iterators and interfaces and point out common mistakes students make with these concepts.</p>
<h2 id="interfaces-review">Interfaces Review</h2>
<p>Remember that an interface is a <em>template</em> for a class. We say that a class <em>implements</em> an interface if the class provides an implementation for all the methods the interface requires.</p>
<p><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Many students (including myself) make the mistake of trying to instantiate an instance of an interface. Remember, you can only instantiate an instance of a <em>class</em> and nothing else. Since an interface is not a class, you can’t make an instance of an interface. Here’s an example of what I mean:</p>
<pre><code>Stack&lt;Integer&gt; s = new Stack();
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is incorrect, because <code>Stack</code> is an interface. A correct version of this instantiation would look like:</p>
<pre><code>Stack&lt;Integer&gt; s = new ArrayStack();
</code></pre>
<p>This code will work because <code>ArrayStack</code> is a class that implements the <code>Stack</code> interface.</p>
<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>
<p>You should recall from 61A that an iterator is an object that returns the next element in some sequence. If this doesn’t ring a bell for you, I would highly encourage you to stop here and either look back at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LIz15B3VmMMhllz1t5HNo9gkOPTGgmAynHNEt6Rzng0/edit#slide=id.g11a6f75162_0_250">61B lecture slides</a> or look at <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/42-implicit-sequences.html">61A material</a> to get a conceptual understanding of what an iterator is. An iterator is a class that implements the <code>Iterator</code> interface, which looks like:</p>
<pre><code>public interface Iterator&lt;T&gt; {
	public boolean hasNext();
	public T next();
}
</code></pre>
<p>In 61B, you are expected to know how to design your own iterator to have a certain behavior. Let’s take a look at a simple example to see what designing an iterator looks like.</p>
<p>Our task is to design an iterator over the all the elements of an array. That is, we want to design an iterator such that every time we call <code>next()</code>, we get the next element of the array.</p>
<pre><code>public class ArrayIterator implements Iterator&lt;T&gt; {
	private int currIndex;
	private T[] myArray;
	
	public ArrayIterator(T[] arr) {
		this.currIndex = 0;
		this.myArray = arr;
	}
	
	public boolean hasNext() {
		return currIndex &lt; myArray.length;
	}
	
	public T next() {
		if hasNext() {
			T next = myArray[currIndex];
			currIndex += 1;
			return next;
		}
		return null;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Common Strategy:</strong> Notice that I used <code>hasNext()</code> in the <code>next()</code> method. Many students implement <code>next()</code> without using <code>hasNext()</code>. It’s not required to do this, but it makes the implementation easier. Logically, if you want to return the next item in a sequence, you should first check if the sequence even has another item to return.</p>
<p><strong>Common Strategy:</strong> Notice I also used private fields <code>currIndex</code> and <code>myArr</code>. These variables help me compute the next item when I need to, and every iterator you design will have similar internal variables. <em>Don’t forget to make these variables private!</em></p>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>You should have seen exceptions in 61A, so I expect that you remember conceptually what an exception is. To reiterate, an exception is a program’s way of saying something is wrong. In Java, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks.</p>
<p>I would normally give some common mistakes and walk through an example, but <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j418bduZS2Ltm6dVVg-b3WpGbOGrRUm6DKRkZCByuaQ/edit#slide=id.p">these slides</a> do that extremely well and pretty much anything I would say is covered in the slides. These slides helped me learn exceptions when I was in the course, so I highly recommend you give them a read.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>I hope you found this guide useful. As always, if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to ask!</p>
