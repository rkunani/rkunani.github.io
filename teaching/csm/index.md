# CSM Teaching Resources

These are resources I distributed to my students when I was part of a teaching organization called Computer Science Mentors. These guides were designed to accompany a set of worksheets and to serve a very specific set of students, so many of the guides skip over certain concepts within the topic they cover. I'm sharing them here in case people find them useful.
